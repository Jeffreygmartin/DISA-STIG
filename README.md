# DISA-STIG

This repository contains STIG implementation scripts and documentation designed to harden Windows systems in alignment with DISA's Security Technical Implementation Guides. Each configuration follows official DoD guidelines to reduce attack surfaces and enforce secure baselines across workstations and servers. Scripts are written primarily in PowerShell and are intended for use in enterprise environments or lab testing scenarios. The goal is to automate and standardize system hardening, while ensuring auditability and compliance.
